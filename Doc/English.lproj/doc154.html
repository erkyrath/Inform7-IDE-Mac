<p>
<p>Actions are impulses to do something, which arise either through typed commands:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>examine tapestry
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and sometimes through &quot;try&quot; phrases occurring in other rules:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before examining the tapestry, try switching the ultraviolet light on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Every action either succeeds or fails, though failure may not be a bad thing (something better may have happened). Besides any rules applied in the source text, actions are subject to basic realism rules. A general rule ensures that actions are rejected if the actor would need to touch something which is out of reach, or see something which is invisible; and a couple of hundred other built-in rules police individual actions. For instance, if the ACTIONS testing command has been used to switch monitoring on, then:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">>unlock cage with watermelon
<br>[unlocking cage with watermelon]
<br>That doesn't seem to fit the lock.
<br>[unlocking cage with watermelon - failed the can't unlock without the correct key rule]
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Actions generated by &quot;try&quot; phrases are allowed to run &quot;silently&quot;, which means that if nothing out of the way happens and they succeed, then nothing is printed. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before examining the tapestry: say &quot;(Switching on the lamp first.)&quot;; silently try switching the ultraviolet light on.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There are many ways to impose extra rules on actions, and we have seen three main kinds: Before rules, intended so that preliminary activities like the one above can happen before the action is tried; Instead rules, which block or divert the intention, or may cause something spectacularly different to happen; and After rules, which allow for unexpected consequences after the action has taken place.
