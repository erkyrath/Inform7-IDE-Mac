<p>Two of the adjectives built into Inform are:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;visible&quot; - the player can see this
<br>&quot;touchable&quot; - the player can touch this
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So we can write descriptions such as &quot;someone visible&quot; or &quot;a touchable container&quot;. We also have adjectives &quot;invisible&quot; and &quot;untouchable&quot;, as might be expected. The visibility adjectives are particularly useful because the following is likely to go wrong:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Helen is in a dark room, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This tests whether the room is dark, of itself; Helen may in fact be able to see by means of a torch, but the room is still &quot;dark&quot;.
<p>
<p>We can also talk about what other people can see and touch:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">something able to be seen by Helen
<br>something which can be seen by Helen
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>are synonymous. Similarly for touch; and we can write such conditions as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if Helen is unable to see Agamemnon, ...
<br>if Cressida can see Troilus, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that it is essential to establish who does the seeing and touching: so &quot;something which can be seen&quot; will not be allowed, whereas &quot;something which can be seen by Helen&quot; will.
<p>
<p>In fact, inside Inform the adjective &quot;invisible&quot; (for instance) has the following straightforward definition:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: Something is invisible if the player cannot see it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The exact definitions of visibility and touchability are complicated, because there are so many ways in which vision and touch can be obstructed, but the gist is that they behave as one would expect. Note that in darkness, nothing is visible, and that nobody can see from one room to another. In general anything invisible is also untouchable, but there are a few exceptions to do with being in the dark. Lastly, the player's own body (the player-character object, which is called &quot;yourself&quot; during play) is both visible (in light) and touchable.
<p>
<p><hr><img border=0 src=beta.png>One day &quot;something which Helen can see&quot; will be allowed, I hope, but for the moment &quot;who&quot; and &quot;which&quot; must be directly followed by the verb.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After examining someone:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] smiles back at you in an unnerving fashion.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we make the rule that governs the gentleman's behavior:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the sinister gentleman can touch something valuable (called the treasure) which is not carried by a person
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the treasure to the gentleman;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The gentleman] slyly acquires [the treasure] and tucks it into his pocket.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That &quot;not carried by a person&quot; prevents the gentleman from stealing from the player (or, less plausibly, from himself). If we did want him to pick pockets, we could just have said &quot;which is not carried by the gentleman&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player is carrying a coin, a bust of Abraham Lincoln, a bottle of sherry, a small pistol, and a wad of Confederate cash. The coin is gold. The pistol is silver.
