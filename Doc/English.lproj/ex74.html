<p>
<p>Ordinarily, if we write
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;manipulate [something]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the &quot;[something]&quot; will only match what is within reach or sight: this is the concept of &quot;scope&quot;, which is what prevents a player from spookily acting on objects from a distance. The parser itself prevents the manipulation rules from ever being invoked on such distant items, which is as it should be.
<p>
<p>Sometimes, though, we positively want to allow this possibility. If we use the special word &quot;any&quot;, as in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;manipulate [any door]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then any door, anywhere in the model world, can be allowed in the player's command. (Of course, the manipulation rules may not do what the player hopes: all that has happened is that the command is now possible to type.) The &quot;any&quot; can be followed by any description of items or rooms, and the latter opens up new possibilities, since rooms are ordinarily never allowed to be named in the player's commands.
<p>
<p>For example, the following gives the player the ability to walk between rooms without giving explicit directions of movement.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Going by name is an action applying to one thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out going by name: say &quot;You walk to [the noun].&quot;; move the player to the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;go to [any adjacent visited room]&quot; as going by name.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(This is really only a sketch: in a finished work, &quot;go to&quot; would produce helpful errors if non-adjacent but visited rooms were named, and we might also worry about rules applying to movement, because the method above will circumvent them.)

<p>
<p>Suppose that, contrary to the usual rules of interactive fiction, we want to allow the player to discover the locations of things he hasn't actually seen yet:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><a href="javascript:pasteCode('&quot;One of Those Mornings&quot;\n\nUnderstand &quot;find [any thing]&quot; as finding.\n\nFinding is an action applying to one visible thing.\n\nCarry out finding:\n\tif the player is carrying the noun\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay &quot;You\'re holding [the noun]!&quot;;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay &quot;You left [the noun] [if the noun is on a supporter]on[otherwise]in[end if] [the holder of the noun].&quot;;\n\tend if.\n\n[The holder of the noun can be a room, a supporter, or a container: the phrase is not picky.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;find [any thing]&quot; as finding.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Finding is an action applying to one visible thing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out finding:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is carrying the noun
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You're holding [the noun]!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You left [the noun] [if the noun is on a supporter]on[otherwise]in[end if] [the holder of the noun].&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The holder of the noun can be a room, a supporter, or a container: the phrase is not picky. We would want to be a little more careful if it were ever possible for an item to have been &quot;removed from play&quot; in our game, since then the holder could be nothing, and that would have odd results. In this particular example, though, that will not arise.
<p>
<p>And that's it, as far as the find command goes. The rest is local color.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Exhibition Room is a room. It contains a closed locked lockable transparent openable container called the display case. The display case contains a priceless pearl. The display case is scenery. The description of the Exhibition Room is &quot;By far the finest thing in the room is a priceless pearl in a glass display case. It should of course be yours[if key is not visible], if only you can remember where you hid the key[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The silver key unlocks the display case.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A jade vase, a teak chest, a bronze teakettle, and a child's burial casket are openable closed containers in the Exhibition Room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After taking the pearl:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The pearl rolls into your hand, gleaming in the oblique light; your fortune is made.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the game in victory.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we want to have the key found in different places when the game is replayed:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play begins:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the space be a random container which is not the display case;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the silver key to the space.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Your watch ticks with maddening loudness.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The time of day is 1:02 AM.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">At 1:08 AM: say &quot;The security guard arrives to find you fumbling about with keys. Curses.&quot;; end the game in death.
